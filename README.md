# List of open source WebRTC Server

March 2021, I am looking for a WebRTC server which I can use in a custom application.

# Jitsi

It is unclear how to create new rooms. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66517071/jitsi-create-room-via-api-or-python

License: Apache

Can be included in custom applications via IFrame.

# OpenVidu

https://openvidu.io/

React and Angular Frontends.

Started in 2017. Younger than other solutions

Seems more suited for custom applications (my use case).

# BBB

Big Blue Button.

Complete solution. Well suited for education.

I guess integration into a custom application is not easy.

# PeerJS

# Nextcloud Talk

# Simple-Peer

# aiortc

Looks too low level.

# Kurento

> Kurento is a low-level platform to create WebRTC applications from scratch. You will be responsible of managing STUN/TURN servers, networking, scalability, etc. If you are new to WebRTC, we recommend using OpenVidu instead.
